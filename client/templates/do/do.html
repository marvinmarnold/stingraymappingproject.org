        <h2>Download the App</h2>
        <p>This app will warn you when your device is likely connected to a Stingray or when a Stingray has been detected nearby. You will then be able to put your phone into airplane mode to protect your information.</p>
        <p>XXX will also map Stingray threat detections on this site in order to contribute to public understanding of how the technology is used and which neighborhoods or political events it targets.</p>
        <p>The app will record only the time and place of the Stingray threat, never any information that would identify you or your phone. Threat location will also be blurred slightly and recorded on the map with an 8-hour time delay for additional protection of user anonymity.</p>
        <p><i>This project came into being because of the incredible work of the <a href="https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector">AIMSICD detection project</a>, which created and continues to refine the Stingray detection technology on which the app relies.</i></p>
