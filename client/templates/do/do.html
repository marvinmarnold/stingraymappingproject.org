        <h2>Download the App</h2>
        <p>Weâ€™ve created a modified version of an existing Android app to notify you when your device is likely connected to a Stingray and to plot those threats onto the map on this site. We won't collect any information that would identify you or your phone, only a Stingray threat level, time stamp, and GPS coordinates. This data will help us understand patterns of Stingray use, including which neighborhoods and political events are targeted.</p>
        <br/>
        <p><i>This project came into being because of the incredible work of the <a href="https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector">AIMSICD detection project</a>, which created and continues to refine the Stingray detection technology on which this app relies.</i></p>
